# CFCE Method

This repository contains documents containing algorithms and other related materials for the CFCE method for solving a 3x3 Rubik's cube.
The main algorithms for the CFCE method, including CLL and ELL.

Steps for the CFCE Method:

- Cross (cross is built usually on bottom, see CFOP tutorials for cross building ideas).
- F2L (Stands for the first two layers, see CFOP tutorials for ideas on how to complete these steps, this is the last step shared with CFOP)
- CLL (Corners of the last layer, this step solves the corners of the last layer without disturbing the first layer)
- ELL (Edges of the last layer, this step solves the edges of the last layer, this is the last step of the method and solves the whole puzzle)
